with-main.py: Contains only Import, ImportFrom, and FunctionDef, and If nodes.
              We need the FunctionDef nodes to contain at least one main method.
              Additionally, the If method needs to check for a main method.

without- main.py: Variety of nodes. In case there are assignments, calls, the pipeline is executable.

ne-runner.py: FunctionDefs without an If condition make the pipeline not executable.

If a mixture of the conditions above: Executable pipeline.
