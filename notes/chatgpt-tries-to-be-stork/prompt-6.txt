-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code response:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import examples.db_playgrounds.postgresqlPlayground as pp

# Assuming you already have a Postgres connection object 'postgres' created
# Adjust the connection details based on your existing connection

path = "data"

# Assuming 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME' is the table you want to retrieve data from
table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME'

# Retrieve data from the Postgres table
from_sql_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}"
from_sql = postgres.execute_query(from_sql_query)
from_csv = pd.DataFrame(from_sql.fetchall(), columns=from_sql.keys())
auto_generate = np.zeros_like(from_csv)

# Add double output, e.g., train/test split from a single file

# Assuming 'train_data' and 'test_data' are your train and test splits
train_data, test_data = your_split_function(from_csv)

# Continue with the rest of your code
